It is a Face recognition python app made with OpenCV. It uses face_recognition library to detect faces. It uses the webcam to detect faces. It can detect various emotions like Happy, Sad, Neutral, Angry and Surprise. It displays the emotions in real-time. It is made by using the FER-2013 dataset to train the model and I have used my own reference pictures to increase the accuracy, along with other libraries and skill-sets. The target is to achieve accuracy above 90%.

To run this project, install OpenCV, Fisherface and Harcasscade libraries etc.

After installing, you can run the code and an integrated html window will pop up to display the emotions.
